in order to add python packages to your lambdas:
1. create a folder named python (important that its named this way!!):
mkdir python
cd python

2. pip install all your required packages in that folder (also important):
pip install -t .

3. zip the entire folder and keep the name

4. go to aws -> lambda -> functions -> layers -> add new layer -> create layer.  and upload your zip file

5. go back to the lambda and add the folder as a layer
