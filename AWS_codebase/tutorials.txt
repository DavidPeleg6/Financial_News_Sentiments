** in order to add python packages to your lambdas:
1. create a folder named python (important that its named this way!!):
mkdir python
cd python

2. pip install all your required packages in that folder (also important):
pip install <package> -t .

3. zip the entire folder and keep the name

4. go to aws -> lambda -> functions -> layers -> add new layer -> create layer.  and upload your zip file

5. go back to the lambda and add the folder as a layer


** connecting to efs. also useful for creating a work env for lambdas:

1. create the efs interface and make sure the fields are: 1000,1000,1000,1000,777 - so that you can get write permissions from anywhere

2. change the root directory path to /mnt/efs1

3. assign security groups that can read and write from anywhere (TODO CHANGE THIS!!)

4. create access point with same SG and same root dir

5. create a EC2 instance and connect to the EFS:
	a. follow directions here to download the tools necessary https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/installing-amazon-efs-utils.html
	b. create a dir called efs
	c. go to the access point's page (the one you just created) and click on the <attach> button on the top left. 
	d. copy the command and paste in your EC2 - you are now connected to the efs

6. create a dir called python in the EC2 (in the efs folder) and install all your packages into there
	pip install <package> -t /root/efs/python

7. go to the lambda you created and go into configuration -> file systems -> add file system. and add the access point you previously added

8. go to configuration -> environment variables and add an environment variable called python path: PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/mnt/efs1/python
