ALL instanced of reading / writing files need to be modified to use proper file paths
these are:
    df.to_csv
    pd.read_csv
    os.mkdir
    load_model (in model.py)
just ctrl+f these troughout EVERY file and then take care of them

go over all of the functions and make sure that they don't modify any files that they don't EXPLICITLY mention modifing

add more 'info' files that just keep track of metadata of other data (shit like date it was made, what sorta data
is in it, etc, etc)

go over how 'gattai' is formed, make sure that future additions will be easy
