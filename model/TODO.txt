ALL instanced of reading / writing files need to be modified to use proper file paths
these are:
    df.to_csv
    pd.read_csv
    os.mkdir
    load_model (in model.py)
just ctrl+f these troughout EVERY file and then take care of them

when loading prexisting data, the model generating ends up with an extra date formatted row that it shouldn't have
( 1970-01-01 00:00:00.000005880  2023-03-17 this sorta shit). fix it later
